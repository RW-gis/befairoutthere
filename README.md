# \#befairoutthere
From a team at Cyclehack 2016 in Glasgow \#cyclehackgla \#cyclehack

This is a repository of simple information (mainly some photos and drawings) showing the tools used to make the \#befairoutthere videos. The team found these tools enabled them to make simple films really quickly, but it took some work to test out and refine ideas. What was learned is shared here so that other people can copy the techniques to make their own simple short films about cycling. 

## The tools

The tools used to make the films were extremely simple 
- a small wooden bike model made from 2 lolipop sticks and a couple of circular wheel shapes, and a 'bulldog' clip. 
- a roll of masking tape
- several very simple cardboard cutout cars (produced on a cutting machine, but scissors would have worked)

The films were shot on a plain floor surface. A tripod helped sometimes, but this wasn't essential. 

Several shots were also taken of people asking the questions that were discussed in the videos. What mattered here was that the sound was clear (not too much background noise).

Everything else was created using imovie software. From starting discussions through prototyping ideas, settling on a filming style, and the creation of 3 completed short videos took about 13 hours with a team of 3. At the end of the first day one video was almost complete. By 4pm the second day two more had been completed.

## The \#befairoutthere videos

The aims behind the videos that the \#befairoutthere team made are described below:

When we cycle in many countries it is difficult to know exactly what the rules say is allowed and what not allowed. This makes it difficult and worrying for people to get started cycling. It's also difficult to explain exactly what the rules are, because often people on bikes are actually forced to spend a lot of time in the grey area between rules. This might not be the case in places where cycling is entirely accepted as an ordinary activity, but in many countries we're actually forced to live in this grey area. Those who don't cycle don't always know this.

The idea arises that if only 'cyclists' would follow the rules then 'they' ('cyclists' - i.e. people on bikes) would be respected. But everyone has a different understanding of what the rules say... so inevitably it's always possible to curse 'cyclists' for not following the rules.

What if we could find a way to explain simply what the rules say... and to show that there are lots of grey areas? The team worked on an idea for filming some simple videos. 

Please respect these ideas if you make more videos in the same style:

Videos should be positive in attitude (the point is partly to reduce fear and tension while increasing understanding at the same time).
Videos should include the hashtag #befairoutthere (be fair out there).
Videos should be made by filming a blank surface with roads marked using masking tape, and a really simple bicycle like ours.
