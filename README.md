# befairoutthere
Cyclehack 2016

When we cycle in many countries it is difficult to know exactly what the rules say is allowed and not allowed. This makes it difficult and worrying for people to get started cycling. It's also difficult to explain exactly what the rules are, because often people on bikes are actually forced to spend a lot of time in the grey area between rules. This might not be the case in places where cycling is accepted fully as an ordinary activity, but in many countries we're actually forced to live in this grey area. Those who don't cycle don't always know this.
The idea arises that if only 'cyclists' would follow the rules then they would be respected. But everyone has a different understanding of what the rules say... so inevitably it's always possible to curse 'cyclists' for not following the rules.
What if we could find a way to explain simply what the rules say... and to show that there are lots of grey areas? We worked on an idea for filming some simple videos. We want to share our videos, but we also want to share the simple idea for making the videos so that other people can make their own.
Please respect these ideas:
Videos should be positive in attitude (the point is partly to reduce fear and tension while increasing understanding at the same time).
Videos should include the hashtag #befairoutthere (be fair out there).
Videos should be made by filming a blank surface with roads marked using masking tape, and a really simple bicycle like ours.
