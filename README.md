# befairoutthere
from a team at Cyclehack 2016 in Glasgow \#cyclehackgla

This is a repository of really simple information (photos and drawings) to support people to make simple short films about cycling.

The \#befairoutthere team worked on prototyping this, and used it to make a number of short films themselves. 

The aims behind the films they made are described below:

When we cycle in many countries it is difficult to know exactly what the rules say is allowed and not allowed. This makes it difficult and worrying for people to get started cycling. It's also difficult to explain exactly what the rules are, because often people on bikes are actually forced to spend a lot of time in the grey area between rules. This might not be the case in places where cycling is accepted fully as an ordinary activity, but in many countries we're actually forced to live in this grey area. Those who don't cycle don't always know this.

The idea arises that if only 'cyclists' would follow the rules then 'they' (people on bikes) would be respected. But everyone has a different understanding of what the rules say... so inevitably it's always possible to curse 'cyclists' for not following the rules.

What if we could find a way to explain simply what the rules say... and to show that there are lots of grey areas? The team worked on an idea for filming some simple videos. We want to share our videos, but we also want to share the simple idea for making the videos so that other people can make their own.

Please respect these ideas if you make more videos:
Videos should be positive in attitude (the point is partly to reduce fear and tension while increasing understanding at the same time).
Videos should include the hashtag #befairoutthere (be fair out there).
Videos should be made by filming a blank surface with roads marked using masking tape, and a really simple bicycle like ours.

# Making the videos

The team used very simple resources. A roll of masking tape, a very simple cut-out cardboard car design, and a very simple design of bike. This repository includes photos and drawings to allow this process to be copied.

For making the films the team used a good camera, but mobile phone footage was working well too. They used imovie to edit the films. From the very start of the idea ("how do we communicate about these ideas?") to the end of producing and publishing 3 films took around 13 hours of work by a team of 3 people.
